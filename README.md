# Android Chat App (Back end repository)
#### A chat app written in android using with a Node.JS + postgresql db backend hosted on Heroku.


This application, lovingly nicknamed 'HooliChat', was developed with a team of 3 individuals for a mobile apps class. The frontend is all written in Android/Java using Android Studio. It uses Google's Firebase, Maps and Places APIs, as well as a free-tier weather API.

The backend (this repo) is served through a node.js server I wrote, which is hosted on Heroku. It uses postgresql to store user and message data, firebase for user notification and google APIs for weather + location services.
